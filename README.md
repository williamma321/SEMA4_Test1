# SEMA4_Test1
Cypress Test

This is the 1.x Branch as stated in the test step 0.1

A sample test for testing the store.google.com and its checkout form error message when user not filling in checkout information

Using Cypress.io and the script in Sema4_test1.js file

User can just load the script file "Sema4_test1.js" into a running version of Cypress.io 

Along with the files in support directory /support/

And files in fixtures directory /fixtures/

I have setup some environment variables in  ./cypress.json

â€¢	Notice the script has to impost wait time in order for the phone configuration to be selected correctly.
